# Arduino Sourcecode for the ATMega32U4 (Leonardo Compatible)

To compile this source code the AESLib is needed [AESLib](https://github.com/DavyLandman/AESLib). Just copy it in your Arduino lib folder and hit compile.
Some warnings are thrown, but the code should run. I've tested the build process on Arduino 1.6.7
